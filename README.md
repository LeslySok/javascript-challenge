## JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

### Background
WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.
There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.
That's why I was hired. I wrote a code that creates a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided. Our users can filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... I only used pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.
The planet Earth needs to know what we have found!

I Created a new repository for this project called javascript-challenge.
